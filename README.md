# Strongs-professional-portfolio

This project is my first portfilio website. I will use this for well executed assignments I complete during the course and for futute personal projects.

As I am working through the many issues that are coming up, I am learning the importance of commiting often and making sure that the commit notes and notes on the code itself are very descriptive. This is helping me when I step away from the project and come back to pick up where I left off. I am seeing how to dig and put together different bits of information from the many sources online to help troubleshoot and come up with a solution to some roadblocks thay I am coming across. One of the biggest things I am getting from this, is hands on practice writing and testing different code at my own pace. While my pace of writing, testing and troubleshooting issues is very slow right now, I believe with time I will evolve into a more knowlegable and efficient programmer.
